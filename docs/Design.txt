	- If the user doesn't have an active session (isn't currently logged in):
		- If the page is Login:
			- Do nothing, they're on the right page to authenticate so let the traffic pass through filter.
		- If the page is any other page on the site:
			- Redirect them to the Login page
	- If the user does have an active session (is logged in):
		- If the page is Login:
			- Redirect the user to the Home page
		- If the page is any other page on the site:
			- Do nothing, they're already logged in so let the traffic pass through filter.
